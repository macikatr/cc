Card Counting Application for Puzzle Pirates

#Installation:#

Just build the Card Counter application with whatever compiler you want (Recommend Visual C++, since it uses Windows API for screen scraping). Then run the resulting .exe. It probably will not work outside of the folder, so if you want to run it from somewhere else, create a shortcut and move that around.

#Running:#
Click the .exe, press enter and move it away from your puzzle pirates client. It will automatically update as the board changes. In the display, 'X' stands for "still in play, but not in your hand", 'o' stands for "In y our hand"
